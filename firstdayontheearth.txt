First day on the earth


I have been living on the earth to time to time, I have felt tired and pain and lost for millions of time. but never quit, so this is new begining and with more difficulties more than ever, anyhow seems like it is getting difficult more and more. as demsond morries explains as humans we are some intergellince species but when we get more and more intelligenece we are going deeper deeper in another troubles. Then we have to find a new solutions for that trouble, with that solution we are explicilty keep on getting to another problem. It is a cricle and we are going round and round again again and we had been doing this for millions of times in this journey.
we had been father of anothe son and we had been a son of another father, we had been daughter of another mother or we had been mother of another mother
